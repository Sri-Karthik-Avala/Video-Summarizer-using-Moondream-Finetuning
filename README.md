The primary objective of this project is to develop a system that can automatically extract key frames from video files and generate descriptive summaries of these frames. 
This is achieved by utilizing the Moondream2 model, which processes and analyzes the visual content within the frames. 
The ultimate goal is to create a robust and efficient tool for detailed video analysis that can be used for various applications, especially in the domain of surveillance.

The motivation behind this project stems from the increasing need for automated video analysis tools in various industries. 
Traditional methods of video analysis are time-consuming and require significant human effort. 
By leveraging AI and ML models, we can automate the process of extracting and analyzing key frames from videos, thereby saving time and resources. 
Additionally, the ability to generate detailed descriptions of video content has numerous practical applications, such as enhancing security measures through better surveillance and improving video content management systems.

Analyzing large volumes of video data manually is a daunting and inefficient task. There is a need for an automated system that can efficiently process video files, extract significant frames, and provide meaningful descriptions of the visual content. 
The challenge lies in accurately identifying key moments in the video and generating relevant summaries that capture the essence of each frame. 
This project aims to address this problem by utilizing the Moondream2 model to create a comprehensive solution for automated video analysis.
